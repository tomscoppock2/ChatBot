Creating a web chat bot interface that interacts with OpenAI on Azure and utilizes Cognitive Search for Retrieval Augmented Generation involves several steps.

The chat bot is set up to work with the hotel sample, in the Microsoft Learn training:

Download and run the postman project to set up this search database, then update the endpoints and API key in the script file.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This code is to illustrate how to use the RAG pattern using OpenAI. The code is not secure and should not be deployed to publicly accessible websites as the API keys are available in plain text.


Below is a general outline to guide you through the process:
1. Set Up Azure Resources:

    Create Azure Account:
    If you don't have an Azure account, sign up for one here.

    Create a Cognitive Services Resource:
        In the Azure portal, navigate to "Create a resource."
        Search for "Cognitive Services" and create a new resource.
        Choose the appropriate settings and obtain the API key and endpoint for the resource.

    Create a Search Service:
        In the Azure portal, navigate to "Create a resource."
        Search for "Azure Cognitive Search" and create a new service.
        Configure indexers and data sources for your specific needs.

    Set Up OpenAI API:
        If you haven't already, sign up for the OpenAI GPT API and obtain your API key.

2. Create HTML and JavaScript Files:

    HTML Structure:
    Create an HTML file with a simple structure for your chat bot UI. Include elements for the chat history, input box, and send button.

    JavaScript Logic:
    Create a JavaScript file (script.js) to handle user input, make API requests to OpenAI and Azure, and update the chat history.

3. Implement OpenAI Integration:

    Make OpenAI API Request:
    Use the OpenAI API key to make a request and get the bot's response in the callOpenAI function.

    Handle OpenAI Response:
    Process the response from OpenAI and extract relevant information.

4. Implement Azure Integration:

    Make Azure Cognitive Search Request:
    Use the Azure Cognitive Search endpoint to make a request and get additional information based on the user's query.

    Handle Azure Search Response:
    Process the response from Azure Cognitive Search and update the chat history.

5. Style Your Chat UI (Optional):

Style your chat interface using CSS (styles.css) to make it visually appealing.


6. Testing:

Test your chat bot interface, ensuring that messages are sent to OpenAI and Azure as expected, and that the responses are displayed correctly in the chat history.
7. Deployment:

Once everything is working as expected, consider deploying your chat bot interface to a hosting service or platform.

Remember to handle error cases, implement security measures, and optimize your code for a better user experience. This is a simplified guide, and you may need to adjust it based on your specific requirements and the APIs you are using.
